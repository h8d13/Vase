# grome_lum

- This section assumes some degree of familiarity on how to modify grub. And do be careful doing stuff like this as it can leave your system unbootable if used unproperly.

Inside this repo you will find helpers scripts to do anything you want with your Grub menu. Like mount an ISO directly as an entry.

## Grub2 Keymaps

Took me 24h to not be on outdated documentation (which will break your setup btw) so made a script to save time for others. 

Thanks to this blog post [FitzBlog](https://fitzcarraldoblog.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/how-to-change-the-keymap-keyboard-layout-used-by-the-grub-shell-in-gentoo-linux/) And W to gentoo users for going in exact detail and how to do something.

---

Basically when running `grub-mklayout` to generate the layout file: get error: `ckbcomp` not found on arch. So you just need to make sure to have it from the AUR (hopefully becomes a core package). This is a large perl script that just maps/converts keys to a grub compatible format `.gkb` I've included it directly in the repo here as it's unlikely to change that much. 

```
KB_LAYOUT="fr"
KB_VARIANT="azerty"
```

Make sure to set these and variant can be left empty as `""`. 

Careful that grub (and system critical pieces in general) are often restricted to 1-127 range. So don't use special chars in users/passwords, etc. And are case sensitive! Also non-latin layouts are generally a very bad idea with bootloader (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese variants, Jpanese, Korean, Indic, Greek, etc)

> At this point you can verify it works by pressing `c` in the grub menu and checking keys are properly registered.

This part does assume you have an install with existing `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` but these are pretty standard and are included in `xkeyboard-config` required by: `libxkbcommon  xorg-server-common`

## Grub2 Passwords

Included a second script that can generate the hash append it to the same file we just modified.

But this already covers a large vector that nobody can edit your launch lines (common exploit of adding rw and spawing a shell) or use the rescue shell without your user/pw.

By default I've set that root + sudo user invoker can use the password you have set. 

But you can easily modify:

Using `grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2`

1. Single/Multiple superusers with full access:
```
set superusers="root alice bob"
password_pbkdf2 root [root_hash]
password_pbkdf2 alice [alice_hash]
password_pbkdf2 bob [bob_hash]
```

2. (Optional) Different permission levels - regular users vs superusers:
```
set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root [root_hash]
password_pbkdf2 user1 [user1_hash]  # Regular user, no superuser privs
```

3. (Optional) Per-entry types
```
# Find the info you need:
sudo grep -A15 "menuentry 'Arch Linux'" /boot/grub/grub.cfg | head -20

menuentry 'Arch Linux (Protected)' --users "root,hadean" {
      load_video
      set gfxpayload=keep
      insmod gzio
      insmod part_gpt
      insmod fat
      echo 'Loading Linux linux-zen ...'
      linux /vmlinuz-linux-zen root=UUID=YOURUUID rw zswap.enabled=0 rootfstype=ext4 locale=en_GB loglevel=3 quiet
      initrd /intel-ucode.img /initramfs-linux-zen.img
  }
```

Can also use `--unrestricted` or `--users root` for example.

4. Too lazy for custom entries but still want some protection.

```
sudo sed -i 's/\${CLASS} \\\$menuentry_id_option/\${CLASS} --unrestricted \\$menuentry_id_option/g' /etc/grub.d/10_linux
```

You can use `sed -i.backup` if you want to keep the original file to check/compare. But make sure to remove it after so it doesn't get parsed by `grub-mkconfig`

This will remove the restriction from default boot entry but keep the password protection for command line and edit launch config. Edits line 113 and 115. 

Then `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

## Grub2 Rescue

Basically let's say you `rm -rf /usr/bin` this provides a utility script to have a rescue env (copied from a USB to a physical partition) in your grub entries. To then mount and perform required maintenance. This is also useful for testing installations .
